I would also like to thank the makers of any game I have ever played in my lifetime, larp or otherwise, as each of them have contributed in some way to what you are about to read. I want to especially thank all of the hard working staff and imaginative players of &ldquo;The Trials of Terra Nova&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wanderlust&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Kishar&rdquo;. You are all wonderful people with whom I am proud to have shared many adventures, and look forward to sharing many more! I must extend a huge round of applause to every single person who donated to our successful Kickstarter! That money will not only ensure we have a game site for every game this year, it will also go towards making this game even better than it ever could have been. Individual thanks go to Austin Clerkin for his knowledge of bookkeeping and a will to share it with Ashley and I; Eric &lsquo;Thorson&rsquo; for his help in balancing out the horrid power swings in the racial system; Katherine Fosso for making more than one of the homelands more in depth; and last but certainly not least, Ashley Kaufman. She has helped me make this game happen more than any other, and I am proud to have her help in steering this game in the right direction. For or all your efforts in the past, present, and future, I thank you!</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3 c4">World Setting</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c38"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c38"><span class="c5">Welcome to Xep, an Earth-like planet in a different time and place than our own; most of which is currently in a time similar to what we refer to as the &ldquo;middle ages&rdquo;. The lands here are divided into only two massive continents, the bigger of which is known as Focul. This incredibly diverse continent houses eleven of the thirteen nations found on Xep. These regions have long been torn by traditions of races keeping to themselves, and the ensuing violent struggles for personal territory that come with them. Many felt as though they were doomed to remain locked in this war perpetually, until that fateful day when something awful happened that proved itself a far worse threat than mere racial differences. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Without warning, a portal to the Destroyers Den; a hellish dimension that was built as a prison for unruly lifeforms and the enemies of the Pantheon, tore open and spilled forth a handful of beings one would find in their darkest nightmares. Overnight, the city of Snide was reduced to a smoldering, blood-soaked maze of lost lives and debris at the hands of a horde of demons and undead. They claimed the ruins for their own and gathered their strength behind the safety of a force field. However, they were without leadership thanks to a group of mercenaries nearly lost their lives in the defeat of the Fallen Angel now known as Harrow. It goes on to tell of how their lives were saved by a source of magic thought lost for nearly a decade; a rare gem called a Soul Orb, that can instantly restore the of life of a mortal being.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Ki-Zen, the oldest and most powerful mortal on the planet, personally felt the loss of each life taken that night. His heart was heavy with sadness as he watched over those he had hired to carry out a seemingly simple mission. While they survived thanks to the Soul Orbs, they were all badly &nbsp;poisoned by an inky black ichor that was only countered after a steady stream of rare antitoxins over the course several days. Ki-Zen saw to it they were tended to by the finest doctors he could find, and they all made a full recovery. They were well compensated for their efforts, and offered a place among his new army.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">These mortals earned the title of the Elite, and became the first members offered the chance to band together under his guidance in order to end this tragedy before it grew worse. Ki-Zen put forth a call to every kingdom and corner of Xep; a welcome to those of any race or social standing, that if they be strong of heart and capable of great deeds yet undone, may they step forward to aid in the reclamation of the world they call home. Some called this move an act of desperation, a plea for help falling upon deaf ears; but as fate would have it, many more recognized this as a chance for the childish behaviors of the past to be put aside. The cause grew great attention quickly, and an army unlike Xep had ever seen took shape before his very eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">By the following morning, the news had already reached the opposite side of the planet. On the continent of Londranis, a place said to be unreachable from Focul without the use of magic, the industrious nation of Cogland decided to finally share their knowledge and advanced technologies with the mainlands after nearly twenty years. Pocket watches, explosives, a variety of new age firearms, steam power, and Kurrent (electricity produced by &lsquo;bottling&rsquo; lightning) were among the many inventions shared with all of Focul, along with the know how to properly use and reproduce them. These gifts were distributed to the leaders of every major nation and kingdom, but they were not well received by all. Some nations became uneasy with the realization that they had until now lacked such clearly superior weapons and defenses; while others paid them no heed to them at all. Either way, no one was simply ignoring the danger posed by the gathering army of undead and demons.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Little did all these brave mortals know that, like those responsible for the current calm before the storm, they would not be alone in their coming struggles. In fact, the Pantheon had taken notice of their efforts and for the first time in nearly a century they were humbled by the decisions of mortals choosing to fight back against forces unknown. The Balance, the harmony of both good and evil existing at once, was now in very real danger of favoring the evils of the world. If such a thing were to occur, it is said that endless darkness would befall the skies as they filled with smoke, the oceans and seas would boil away, and all life on Xep would be snuffed out as the violet flames continued to spread and consume everything in their path. To ensure this outcome is avoided, the Pantheon has promised to provide Ki-Zen with the resources he needs to have a chance in this war. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Another sunrise is nearly upon us, and it will be a more than just a new day. It will be a new era; a time when the ways of old are shaken at their core. The history of Xep is still being written, and now its in your hands! What say you? Will you stand and fight with Ki-Zen and the Elite? Or will you cower in your home and wait for the war to come to you?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Marshals</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Also called an ST (storytellers), these are the referees of the game, usually stated at the beginning of each game. They will always wear something specific to designate them as such. What they say, goes. If they are wrong, it is up to another staff member to correct them, not the players. Doing so disrespectfully will eventually result in you being banned from playing the game altogether. If they make you play something out incorrectly they will be informed etc. Marshals caught cheating or treating players unfairly will be subject to losing their position and/or being asked to leave and not come back at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Medical Staff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Those with medical training may specify this to staff, in order to become eligible as a Health Marshal. We never wish for anyone to get hurt or injured, but accidents do happen. In such cases Health Marshals will be called forth to help provide for those in need. This position not only shows your character in real life, but earns you a small in game reward as well. They will have authority to remove a player from play if they feel they are injured or ill, or endangering themselves. Health Marshals will also be expected to assist with ensuring all players have water while on the trails as well. You are not in charge, you are just another line of defense against players becoming dehydrated or worse. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Cast</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">These are the players who are the main characters of the story, including yourself. Stories will generally revolve around those characters and the choices they make. These characters are referred to as PC&rsquo;s, or Player Characters.. Of course there are countless people who also live in this world besides them, referred to as NPC&rsquo;s. Without these hard working players you have no baddies to fight, no merchants to buy from, etc. They are here for the enjoyment of the PC&rsquo;s, but don&#39;t forget, they want to have a good time too!</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">In Game &amp; Out of Game Knowledge</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Some things you will know regardless, but you cannot use out of game knowledge to give you an edge in the game. There are times where things will be &ldquo;unseen&rdquo;, &ldquo;unheard&rdquo;, &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; etc. These things are to be just that. While you are aware of them, your character is not! Using information acquired while not in character is a form of cheating.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Out of Genre Items</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">So, while the game encourages immersion, we never aim to deprive you of things that you need for medical reasons, or to remove all traces of the modern world from sight; thats just not feasible. What we can do is say, in the case of an inhaler or other medical supplies one may have, are more than welcome to be brought along, and not doing so would be the case in which there would be a problem. As for things like cell phones and the like, please leave them and all other non essential items with your out of game things. We are here to have a good time, not make you miserable!</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Cheating &amp; Offensive Behavior</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">There are many forms of this. Just dont do it. It isn&#39;t necessary, and it&rsquo;s likely that the other players who have paid to have a good time are not going to be fond of your doing so. Everyone gets in the moment time and again, and we have all &ldquo;fudged&rdquo; some numbers time and again, it happens. This game is designed to give its players more than enough advantages. Repeat offenders will be banned from returning to future events, as we are all (hopefully) mature enough men and women that we can all play fair and still have fun.</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Bottle To Blade Rule</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">To avoid injury and sickness at game, no one who has had alcohol in the last 6 hours will be allowed to play. Being caught under the influence of alcohol during game will result in your removal, and you may be asked not to return as well. This is a precaution that staff is more than comfortable in enforcing. We hope to never have to deal with this issue.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Game Fee</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">In order to cover the fees of whatever site we are camping overnight, the cost to PC may fluctuate slightly until we have a dedicated site. For now it is as follows: </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">PENDING (See the Facebook Group for details)</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Check In</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">This is where you sign in and pay your game fee if you havent already. This is also your last chance to spend any XP or Sage Points before the game officially begins. If you are signing in for your first game, you will also have to sign a legal waiver in order to play.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Character Packets</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c5">Players will each receive a packet with all the equipment, coin, etc. belonging to one of their characters at the beginning of each event. These packets are returned to staff at the end of each game. This is to ensure all things related to game are kept together and are accessible to staff for updating between games.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Armor Rating</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Light Armor is heavier clothing or light leathers with </span><span class="c5 c9">minimal coverage</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Medium Armor is chainmail and thicker leathers that</span><span class="c5 c9">&nbsp;must cover your entire torso</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Heavy Armor should appear heavy and </span><span class="c5 c9">must cover two thirds of your body</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">The Grade System</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Many abilities in this book mention in their description that they may be purchased multiple times, and others do not. As a rule of thumb, if it states it can be purchased more than once, it can be. If not, you should assume it can only be purchased once.</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Discount Stacking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">There are certainly various ways to reduce the cost of your XP expenditures, and if you possess more than one that would reduce the cost of the same purchase, each of them apply at once, unless noted. This is to ensure that certain builds will learn specific abilities much faster than others, as they should. Purchased abilities have a mandatory base cost of at least 1 XP. That makes sure your character does not simply receive new powers without having tried at least trying to learn them.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Ammunition</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">If you carry a firearm, you must have ammunition for it as well. Each &ldquo;Ammunition&rsquo; item card you possess allows you to carry a stated number of rounds; coming in increments of 10, 20, and 30. These item cards stack of course. Expended rounds cannot be retrieved until the end of the encounter in which they are fired. Be sure to write your characters name on each dart to be sure it is returned to its proper place.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3 c4">COMBAT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The fighting in this system occurs with contact friendly weapons and tactics, allowing the players to engage one another without the constant threat of injury. You must actually say the full damage call from a single attack before swinging again with that weapon, and after three unanswered attacks to your opponent, you must wait at least one second before engaging them again. Blows that are physically or mechanically parried, resisted, etc. do not count towards the three swing &ldquo;limit&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Ability Refreshes (Arcs)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Every 8 Hours of game is known as an Arc. At the beginning of each Arc, all your abilities that are limited to a certain number of uses per Arc become immediately available again! If you gain a certain number of Mana at the beginning of an Arc, that refreshes as well. </span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">The Definition of an Encounter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">An encounter, is defined as the period of time between when an NPC first appears, to when they have all gone. As an example, if the PCs are walking down a trail and they meet a guard standing at his post, you are officially in an encounter. Until it is just the PC&rsquo;s and they have been told they have the trail, it is considered the same encounter. You will not always have combat during an encounter.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Non-Combatant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">These people have come to play the game but do not wish to involved in the combat portion of the game. They are still welcome on missions, but will always be assumed to have been overwhelmed or captured alive, etc. if the other characters are all downed. These players cannot carry weapons and they are never to be physically attacked in any manner, save touching them with your weapon and calling damage once every other second that you maintain contact with the target.</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Brothers Keeper</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">If a player is about to do something unsafe, call Brothers Keeper and help them avoid it. This is a legitimate way to keep you and your fellow players from stepping in a hole, tripping over fallen tree limbs, standing on an anthill, or any number of other unforeseen hazards that can be caused by running around like a bunch of crazy people in the woods!</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Drop Rule</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">You cannot use bows with strings against targets within 10 feet. You cannot move into drop range but if they move into your range on their own you can drop the readied shot to the ground and call your damage as a pointcast. Bow weapons should have no more than a 20 pound draw if they are real bows. You can use approved toy bows. You can also use packet archery instead, and do not suffer this ruling, but must count to 5 and pull out a packet to throw in place of an arrow.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Player VS Player</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Players are held accountable for their actions, but this does not stop them from causing each other personal harm. However, there is an exception to this rule. While on the sacred grounds of Frostlight, no one can be killed due to the powerful divine magics that protect the fortress and all its inhabitants. You are not invincible, as you still experience all forms of pain and suffering, but you cannot drop below 1 HP. This blessing allows for those in training to employ lethal weapons without the worry of accidental casualties. There are also plenty of talented healers and physicians under the employ of the Vanguard.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Healing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">When you lose HP there are a few different ways to get it back, and cheat death yet again. There are alchemical potions that restore hit points through combining and brewing natural herbs and other ingredients. Another method is physical medicine, involving the use of a Vita-Pack to close the most grievous of wounds. Last but far from least, there is magic; this is often the quickest way to close a wound and get someone back in the fight.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Dying</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">If your HP reaches zero, you remain conscious, but you may not continue to fight. You must take a knee or otherwise indicate you have been &lsquo;dropped&rsquo;. At this time you begin a 120 count (2 minutes). While being Stabilized or Healed, halt your count but do not lose track of your timer, as you must start from there again if they are not successful. If you are not stabilized or healed for at least 1 HP in that time you will die. However, this isnt a problem if you have a Soul Orb; the very life essence of another being, trapped within a small red crystal. It may sound morbid, but you will certainly be glad you have it one day. Each PC is gifted one of these items at character generation!</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Loot</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">When you come upon a downed NPC, you can search them for items, coin, and other various . by completing a full 10 second count. You may not loot fellow PC&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Currency</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Silver Piece </span><span class="c5">- Once this was the only denomination of coin. 5 Silver is equal 1 Gold.</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Gold Piece</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Once a rare thing to see, the Gold piece is now a common denomination used on Xep. It is said that the God Midan made and distributed these himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Item Cards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">These are a means of giving players weapons, armor, potions and other various things within the in game world, without having to have the actual physical item. Item cards should have a phys-rep if possible. You may not use things such as weapons without having both, the proper item card and phys-rep.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Safety Specifications</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c5">Each weapon will be inspected at the start of each game to ensure they have been maintained between games. If a weapon is deemed unsafe, it can be fixed (if possible) and then inspected. This is an important step towards the safety of each of our players.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Melee</span><span class="c5 c9 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">weapons will be checked for safety at each game. There are many acceptable latex weapon brands out there, but home-made weapons are acceptable as well, should they follow safety guidelines.</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Firearm</span><span class="c5 c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">phys-reps must be approved. There are lots of acceptable choices, but the one you pick must be single fire only, nothing automatic. No &lsquo;slamfire&rsquo; can be used! You must provide your own darts, and you should write your characters name on each of them if you would like them returned. ORANGE TIPS MUST REMAIN VISIBLE, even if you paint the remainder of the weapon! This is to indicate the gun is only a toy, and it is not optional.</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Bow</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;phys-reps that are not Nerf guns can have no more than a 25 pound draw. Crossbows should only be firing foam darts.</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Arrow</span><span class="c5 c9 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">phys-reps can be purchased online at many retailers. All arrows will be CLOSELY monitored for safety and wear. You may also use packet archery if you wish.</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c3">Packets</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;must be at least the size of an eye socket, and should be made of cloth and filled with only biodegradable materials in case it is lost. Foam stress balls of certain types can also be used if they are approved by staff.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Unique Weapons</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c5">Some weapons do not fit with any of the above items. Any such weapon can be submitted to staff to be examined for safety and aesthetics. If staff believes the weapon to be a worthwhile addition to the game, it will be given stats and allowed into the game.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Weapon Lengths</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">One-handed Weapons</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;can be 20 to 45 inches in length.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">EXCEPTIONS:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">Dagger</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Length: 12 to 18 inches.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">Flail</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Detailed safety specs coming!</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">Throwing Weapons</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Length: Must be core-less. 6 to 12 inches.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">Natural Weapons</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- 24 inches, unless otherwise specified.</span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c5 c9">Two-handed Weapons</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;can be 48 to 72 inches in length.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c11 c1 c16 c12"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3 c4">Descriptors</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Damage types matter in the overall flow of combat. Some beings will resist, reduce, or even be immune to certain damage types; while others will be forced to take the entirety of that same damage should the attack land successfully.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Basic Damage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">This type of damage is called as just a number, which indicates the amount of damage the attack or effect is inflicting. We as staff just did not feel the need to enforce descriptors for these attacks beyond the damage itself. If for some reason the need to add them arises, we will deal it will. Until then, we shall try this system.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Nonbasic Damage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">This type of damage is most commonly inflicted by magic, and the often hostile wildlife forms that now inhabit the various environments found on Xep. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Air</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Focused bursts of wind that become concussive physical attacks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Acid</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Corrosive fluids that are capable of dissolving most any material on the planet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Earth</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- The abrasive bits and pieces of nature. Sticks and stones can break bones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Fire</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Damage caused by heat or flames. One of the most offensive schools of magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Holy</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Pure white &lsquo;light&rsquo; that can do anything from heal wounds, to vaporizing the Unholy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lightning</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Natural electricity, focused into bolts of bright, crackling pain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Magic</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Raw magical energies, concentrated into a physical form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unholy</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Described as a black &lsquo;light&rsquo; used most often used for pure destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Water</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Water is an element of life, and an all too often underestimated power source.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Critical Damage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Once inflicted, this type of damage cannot be avoided without the use of a Phase, or an Immunity to the declared type (if any). The Critical descriptor is sometimes added to attacks or effects. The following types are always considered to be Critical, unless otherwise noted.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Life Drain</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Part of your life force is ripped away, healing its new host in the process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Poison</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Poison damage may not be healed without employing certain items or abilities.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3 c4">Status Effects</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">&nbsp;<br>Physical Effects</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bind Limb</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Declared limb is locked in place.

You may walk in a small circle as long as the affected leg remains in contact with that spot. Leaning far enough to cause your heel to rise is considered bad form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Knockback</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You are thrown in a straight line 5 paces, unless otherwise stated. This should be done in a timely manner, as you are not a valid target while taking these steps. Do not abuse this in order to avoid combat, that is a form of cheating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Paralyze</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Your muscles seize up, rendering you unable to move, speak, or activate abilities not already in effect for the duration. You may still use resists during this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sleep</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You must drop your hands to your sides and pretend to be in a deep sleep for the duration. You immediately wake up if you are damaged before the end of this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Slow Motion</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You may only move and fight at a painfully slow speed for the duration. If a staff member asks you to move slower, please do so.

If a leg is affected you suffer the Snare effect for the duration. If an arm is affected you suffer a Disarm effect to that arm, and it must remain at your side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Snare</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You may only move at a slow walk for the duration. You still fight at normal speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Stun</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You can only defend yourself, suffer frozen foot on a single leg, and cannot cast spells or activate abilities not already in use for the duration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Weakness</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You cannot use Strength or Feat of Strength, deal only base weapon damage, and any Mana you possess becomes inaccessible for the duration.</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Mental Effects</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dominate</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You will obey basic commands from the user, such as &ldquo;take that man&#39;s gold&ldquo;, &ldquo;defend me&rdquo; or &ldquo;get me some water&rdquo;. Being told to do something such as kill a loved one will likely end the effect instantly. You retain the knowledge of what you have done. Higher forms of this effect may not follow these rules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rage</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You are overwhelmed by anger and must meaningfully attack the target or targets nearest to you, whether enemy or ally. You will still attack foes over allies if both are present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Fear</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You must immediately move out of melee range of the user, and may only defend yourself against that target for the duration.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lure</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You must move towards the users current location before taking any other actions. Once there you may still fully engage the user and other targets you can reach; but while under this effect, if the user moves away, you must move with them if possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pacify</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You relax and cannot feel any form of anger or make aggressive actions for the duration, even if damaged or otherwise harmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Taunt</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You must meaningfully attempt to engage the user in combat immediately, ignoring all other targets for the duration.

This ability is player activated, allowing them to choose when it is used. These cannot be used to stop Critical damage or a status effect that is not paired with damage. These must be activated individually, and cannot be stacked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Blast</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- This is to indicate that an attack, ability, or spell deals area damage. If delivered by dart, arrow, or packet this targets its final resting place. If delivered by Pointcast or melee range pointcast, this affects the area around the target. Unless stated, this distance is roughly melee range.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Burst</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- This indicates an attack, ability, or spell is dealing its damage and effects to a large area with you at its center. Unless stated, this distance is roughly melee range.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Come Along</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- This is to simulate carrying another person. A player with the Strength ability can carry two other people, moving at Snared speed. Those without this ability may only carry one.

You cannot impose yourself in front of another person and then use this ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Enhancement</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- These effects add damage or the like to attack to increase their effectiveness for a short time. Only one effect of this type may be applied at a time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Heal</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You immediately gain the specified number of hit points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Hit Points (HP)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- These represent a character&#39;s capacity to remain on their feet when taking a beating. Every race has a base HP, gaining more based on Class, and abilities. If your HP is ever at zero, you are in Bleed Out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Melee Range Pointcast</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You successfully hit a target within roughly two feet of you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Mindless</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- This being is Immune to Mental status effects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Minimal</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- The attack only dealt 1 damage to the target, due to some type of resistance.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Out of Game</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- The affected item or player is not able to interact with the in game world for the duration.

You take nothing!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Resist</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You negate a single attack or effect of a specified type, taking no damage or status effects from it. Most often these cannot be used to stop Critical damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Stabilize</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- You are no longer in Bleed Out, but you remain unconscious at 0 HP.

All this information is compiled on your character sheet as quick reference. Remember, everyone speaks the common tongue, but you may also choose to gain the language for your homeland for free at creation; unless you are an explorer, in which case you gain two languages instead (as described in Explorer).</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Three Game Rule</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I understand that when choosing a character in a new system, that you may end up not liking something as much as you thought you would, for a multitude of reasons. You have three games to decide what you want to play, when you PC your fourth game, that character sheet is locked in. All changes made to it before that are inconsequential.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Character History</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">What did your character do before joining the Elite? What are their goals outside of adventuring? Do they have a family? What are they afraid of? Asking yourself all these questions now will add up to better immersion later! By writing up a back story and submitting it to staff, we can include your character more directly in the plot of the game. You will also receive 1 Saga Point per page of backstory you provide, to a maximum of 4.</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Starting Gifts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Each PC begins play with 15 Silver (equal to 3 Gold), a single mundane weapon (which can be a firearm, but you must still purchase ammunition), and a single set of mundane armor for free. They each also receive a one time gift of a Soul Orb; which is essentially an extra life. These are only the beginning of your many treasures to come.</span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Experience Points</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Each player begins with 30 XP to build with at character generation, growing each game they attend according to the chart below. As you can see, after gaining 90 XP this way a single character begins receiving significantly less per game. This is to encourage players to eventually retire their current PC or make an alternate character who can grow faster. The chart on the following page shows how your character will gain experience over their first two years. After a characters twelfth game, their XP gains from attendance alone drops significantly. This is to ensure that newer characters are still effective in combat, as well as to promote the unlocking of a second character slot using only 10 Saga Points.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">GAME</span></p><a href="#" name="d24ef3c2d96e4a84fca8e475b069e37cd8a4006f"></a><a href="#" name="1"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c39"><tbody><tr class="c33"><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">0</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">1</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">2</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">3</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">4</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">5</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c9 c24">6</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">7</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">8</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">9</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">10</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">11</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">12</span></p></td><td class="c21 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">13+</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c33"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">30</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c9 c26 c37">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+5</span></p></td><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c37 c9 c26">+2</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c51"><td class="c21" colspan="14" rowspan="3"><p class="c6 c1"><span class="c20 c24 c9">If you possess multiple characters on the books, this chart applies to each of them individually.

As time passed and crops withered or failed to grow altogether, it become known as Blight, and has since been referred to as such by most. Once it at least appeared to be a suitable place to settle down, though currently it&rsquo;s nothing more than a disheveled arrangement of farm houses and mud. Several years ago, plague wrought this town of its weakest members; a result of poor hygiene and a lack of doctors. Most of the towns religious figures have long left.

The biggest and most populated of the three is called The Steam Sector. Brilliant minds here have harnessed steam to power all sorts of mechanical devices that now comprise a city that always seems to be on the move; after all, this is where a still unknown individual successfully developed firearms and other weaponized explosives. The second largest of the colonies is known as the Blue Quarter, a place that welcomes those with coin to spend. It got its name from the local method of power that created its signature black and blue atmosphere. By stringing &ldquo;bottled lightning&rdquo; in windows, across rooftops, and on street corners like lanterns it stays surprisingly well lit, even at night. The region closest to the area that was destroyed by the removal of a tremendous portion of land (when Nimbuss left, is known as Flicker, and its the only portion of the island that has unreliable electricity; largely due to the lack of people willing or able to feed the coal burners all day.

When first discovered by explorers, they named it &ldquo;The Sea of Sand and Fire&rdquo;, and it was labeled as nearly uninhabitable. Until years later when the Armaga were accidentally discovered, it was widely believed only a small handful of plants and creatures even dwelled here. Bad timing lent its hand in the resulting bloodbath that only three of the party escaped; after all, they interrupted a precise ritual being performed to revive the wife of their King, resulting in its failure. After the massacre and the formation of armed patrols of the lands, operating under orders to kill trespassers, the wise made efforts to avoid even the sight of their sands for some many years. Eventually, peace was made under a new king and U&rsquo;rah&rsquo;ba was built, less than three miles from a heavily traveled trade route. This enclosed city is mostly a marketplace, now best known for its oddities and rare trinkets from all corners of the globe. This city pays homage to all the Gods and Goddess, and those who are raised here following the path of faith often find favor with more than one deity. The law of this kingdom states, &ldquo;Each man, woman, and child of these lands, shall be free to worship whomever they please, lest they be found guilty of inviting demons and their like into this world.&rdquo; It is told there is a hidden city out there named Oasis; a place of legend, said to have rivers of clean running water that is always cold despite the heat of the sun, and lush plantlife ripe with enough shade and food an army could survive for all their natural years. Many brave and well seasoned adventurers have sought it out, and none who have returned claim to have found anything more out there than the welcoming arms of death.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Advantages</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cultural Hub</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Folk of all trades gather here to display their wares, so you know the value of having an array of talents.

These mountain ranges are dangerous, and not just because of the nightly below zero temperatures. This is also a land of majestic castles, thick fog, rolling rocky hills, vast expanses of forests, and supposedly an unspeakable amount of wealth. Here there are many awe-inspiring sights to behold, such as the city sized dragon skeleton the locals have come to refer to as Skahlin; roughly meaning &ldquo;firestorm&rdquo;. They believe it to be a good luck charm, warding off other dragons by showing them they can be killed, as this was the first of their kind that fell to the likes of a courageous mortal who vowed to end the daily slaughter of his people. No one who was alive then is still alive to tell the tale, but he was obviously a man of his word. These lands were once mostly inhabited by the Roehart, but the other races have trickled down south to live time and again. The cold here is constant, but you get used to it; assuming it doesn&#39;t kill you first. The most common foods here are wild game, such as birds, rabbits and fish, but they are also quite fond of mead!</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Advantages</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A Taste of Home</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- If you have an approved phys-rep, once per Arc while not in battle, you can drink from a &lsquo;Mead Horn&rsquo;, in order to grant yourself a Heal 5.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Skald</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Citizens here know legends quite well, and they tell them time and again as warnings and life lessons.

The &ldquo;Merfolk Mafia&rdquo; run this kingdom now; keeping anything of importance here with them, where few can reach with ease. They continue to get rich while the city crumbles around them. There is a small town on the shores with a few businesses that serve as the eyes and ears of the crime lords below.

The leader of the city is Millis the Crimson, a ruthless bastard who is known to drink the blood of those he has slain to put fear into all others who would seek to upset him. The truth of the matter is that he has long been in possession of an artifact, a massive golden shield that grants him the same type of regenerative capabilities as the Vanquill, as well as some other nasty surprises for those who would seek to part him from either his throne or his shield. It may not surprise you to know, that no other kingdom or army for that matter, has ever declared war on Lanoda. They welcome such news here. </span></p><p class="c1 c12 c8"><span class="c19 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Advantages</span><span class="c5 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beastly</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- Only the tough survive here, and you&#39;ve got the scars to prove it.

They have a simple motto here, which is &ldquo;fulfill needs, instead of greed.&rdquo; Those of this nation tend to value crops and intelligence. Those born here are traditionally given two names: their childhood name and their adult name. Typically their childhood name will reference a small animal, and is a holdover from their nomadic period.

In truth they are immortals, each possessing exceptional and seemingly infinite power. They each have many followers who believe in their ways, and use it as a guideline to live their lives with. The truly devoted, known as Clerics, spend most of their waking lives working as the face and voice of their chosen deity, earning them in return godly powers to aid them in their cause. However, this power can be taken away far easier than it is given, as the one they serve is always watching, ready to remove their gifts should they witness behavior contrary to their pleasing. The ultimate goal of the Pantheon is maintaining the balance of good and evil, allowing both to exist in what peace they are able to make for themselves; though on more than one occasion in the history books, there are stories of personal intervention. It may seem hard to believe, but even the God of Death plays his role in maintaining this balance. There are indeed other Gods and Goddesses in existence, beyond those in the Pantheon. These deities have far less worshippers, and they are known to be outright evil. Men and women who are devoted to them keep this fact a secret to all but those who also praise their master. These deities seek to destroy the balance, and usurp the unmatched power of their kind to transform existence into a case of &ldquo;survival of the fittest&ldquo;. </span></p><p class="c11 c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c11 c1 c8"><span class="c3">Note on Symbols</span></p><p class="c11 c1"><span class="c5">The title above the abilities is the one taken on by the Cleric using said spells.

Those who go above and beyond will be rewarded for it. While casting you cannot attack foes or activate any other abilities, but you may still move freely and defend yourself. If you are damaged while casting you take damage as normal, but must restart your cast time. You do not lose Mana for starting over, but you will lose it if you declare an attack or activate any other offensive spell or ability. To cast a spell you must have at least one free hand to hold the packet or point at your target. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Purchasing Spells</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">You do not have to purchase spells in the order they appear, but you may never have more higher level spells than you do lower level spells.
